# Solaris Skunk Werks About Page

The Solaris Skunk Werks project is a continuation and update of the original SSW tool used to design Battlemechs for use with the Battletech tabletop game. The project includes an update of the SSW design tool for battlemechs, SAW for vehicles, and BFB a tool for generating and maintaining force lists based on the battlevalue rules in Total Warfare.

SSW and SAW are feature-rich environments for 'mech and vehicle designers respectively. Both offer an easy to use interface for designing units, and multiple export formats, including record sheets, tro texts and megamek compatible files for importing. BFB provides a easy to use way to create formations of vehicles and 'mechs, add pilots and crews. It can also create an opposing force through random tables or manual user balancing against battlevalue or tonnage. BFB also allows for batch printing of the forces, and allows saving of the forces to load for later games. 

The Solaris Skunk Werks project is a actively developed project on Github this development includes updates to software for erata, improvements on interface and program, and addition of components as The Battletech Boardgame releases new material. Additionally, SSW-Master is an actively updated archive of cannon designs provided for use with all three programs. The Solaris Skunk Werks programs are written in java, and require either oracle's java openjdk.
